# MusicPlayer-Figma

Developed a comprehensive and visually appealing **Music Player application design** using Figma, incorporating essential screens like **Login**, **Forgot Password**, and **Recover Account** to ensure a user-friendly onboarding experience. The design emphasizes simplicity and clarity, catering to a wide range of users.  

Designed engaging and intuitive interfaces for the **Music Lists**, **Artists**, and **Favorites** sections, focusing on creating an immersive experience for music enthusiasts. The layout and color scheme were chosen to enhance navigation and make music exploration seamless and enjoyable.  

Special attention was given to user experience, ensuring that every element, from buttons to navigation menus, was strategically placed for maximum accessibility. This project highlights the ability to merge **aesthetic appeal with functional design**, resulting in a cohesive and user-centric music application.
